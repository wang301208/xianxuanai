"""Namespace for runtime-generated action modules."""

# Modules created at runtime will be written next to this file and imported via
# :class:`~forge.actions.registry.ActionRegister`. Keeping this package in the
# repository ensures Python can import the generated modules without additional
# packaging steps.
